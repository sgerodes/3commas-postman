# 3commas-postman

A "Plug and Play" postman collection created from the official swagger doc. 
The signature is created automatically.

1. Import the 3commas.postman_collection.json file into your Postman
2. Create an API key-secret pair in your 3commas account. Some endpoints need write permissions. Which exactly can be found on the [official repo](https://github.com/3commas-io/3commas-official-api-docs).
3. Add your API key and secret into the Postman collection variables THREE_COMMAS_API_KEY and THREE_COMMAS_API_SECRET.
